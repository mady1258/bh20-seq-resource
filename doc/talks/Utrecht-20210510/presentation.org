* PubSeq

- Started in lock down biohackathon
- 100+ bioinformaticians participated
- PubSeq started simply as a public data resource with live workflows

* Key points

- No all so-called public repositories are open
- This hampers research

Scientists call for fully open sharing of coronavirus genome data
Nature. 2021 Feb;590(7845):195-196.

- Improved pandemic monitoring:

EMBL-EBI and partners launch new COVID-19 Data Portal
http://www.covid19dataportal.org

* PubSeq

- Make data available for analysis

Do public databases, such as EBI/ENA, make PubSeq irrelevant?

- PubSeq aggregates data
- PubSeq federates data
- PubSeq adds metadata
- PubSeq normalises metadata
- PubSeq provides a metadata search engine

* Geo location

There exist many opportunities for ambiguous entries, such as Memphis
TN and Memphis IN. We decided to settle for Wikidata URIs because (1)
they are unambiguous and (2) allow for fetching more information, such
as population size, density, county, country, and GPS
coordinates.

* Other normalisation/disambiguation

- Sampling
- Sequencing platform
- Protocol
- Analysis (tools)

More metadata?

- Environment
- Clinical

* Add value

- List important mutations
- Find nearest neighbour
- Phylogeny
- Pangenome - PubSeq only
- Live workflows - PubSeq only

* French hacking

Vite ma dose!

* PubSeq is about hacking!

- PubSeq is both a 'hackers' resource and a resource with impact
- Anyone can join, anyone can contribute
- Miles Benton & Joep de Ligt working on affordable hardware

* PubSeq - Current mission!

Mission: global on-the-spot variant detection using cheap technology
   and public compute

What is needed...

- Oxford Nanopore on the spot sequencing - excellent results!
- Mini-GPU does base-calling locally
- Upload sequence into PubSeq
- Triggers workflows for computation
- We can send these mini-labs to India, Africa, anywhere!

* Why do we need public data?

- Remember they said the virus does not mutate?
- Remember they said the virus would get weaker?

- Detect new mutations -> testing
- Detect active mutations -> vaccins
- Do we really know what is happening in India or Africa?
- Dominant mutants will surface - eventually

* Data

- Make data as private as it needs to be
  (Mark Wilkinson)

- Make data as public as possible
  (same thing)

* Viral data

- Q: Does viral data need to be protected?
- Q: Does human data need to be protected?
- Q: Does human clinical data need to be protected?

* Why online compute?

To analyse and mine data effectively

- Online analysis helps sequencing centres that lack bioinformatics
- Funding is for sequencing, not for analysis
- Reproducible analysis and re-analysis of data

* Why public data?

To make online compute possible.

- Without public data there is no open sharing (try Nextstrain)
- Without public data there is no online compute
- Without public data there is no easy sharing of methods/workflows:
  everyone reinvents the wheel
- Without public data analysis is hard and often impossible to reproduce

During a pandemic this is very visible - but it really is a long term
problem we need to address

* PubSeq

Current setup:

- Online compute using common workflow language (CWL)
- Cloud platform sponsored by Amazon OpenData, AWS and Curii
- Virtual HPC at SARA (Sas Swart & Michael Crusoe)
- Permanent identifiers and federated data using IPFS
- Amazon Open Data initiative (TCGA, NCBI Sequence Read Archive etc)

* Innovation

PubSeq as an initiative triggered innovation:

- Pangenome work on SARS-CoV-2 - methods for large scale phylogeny
- Demonstration platform for best practices (CWL, RDF, Arvados)
- Metadata normalisation (Elixir/EBI)

* How can I contribute?

- Analyse data
- Add features; fix stuff
- This is all about being an open initiative
- Data uploads: GenBank & EBI exports

* Take Home Messages

1. FAIR data should be as free and open as possible
   - FAIR does not mean open
   - So called 'public' repositories are often not free and open
   - Even proper public repositories, such as GenBank and EBI/ENA lack
     support for metadata and online compute
2. PubSeq is about query-able metadata
3. PubSeq is about online reproducible workflows
4. Mission: global on-the-spot variant detection using cheap
   technology and public cloud
